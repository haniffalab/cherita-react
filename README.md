# Cherita

## Development

Install [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

Install packages

```sh
npm i
```

Create a ``.env`` file within ``sites/demo`` to store environment variables for Vite to use. Within it set ``API_URL`` to the backend API url like

```sh
API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/
```

Run the demo app

```sh
npm run start-demo
```

The app will automatically reload when changes are made
